# Socket_Switch
Arduino Library for controlling auto learning RF socket switches

This library was tested with JULA anslut socket switches. It should also work with Nexa and PROOVE.

After first trying to decode using a RF sniffer based on a receiver and audacity I found the protocol description here:

which made it a lot easier to make the library.
