# Socket_Switch
Arduino Library for controlling auto learning RF socket switches

This library was tested with JULA anslut socket switches. It should also work with Nexa and PROOVE.

After first spending time trying to decode a remote controller for the JULA switches using a RF sniffer, based on a 433mhz receiver, a PC and audacity I found the protocol description here:

which made it a lot easier to make the library. All credits should go to Jesper Hansen who managed to decode the protocol.
